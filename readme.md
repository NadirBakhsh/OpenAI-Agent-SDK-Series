# OpenAI Agent SDK Series

A practical learning series for building with the OpenAI SDK and agentic AI patterns. This repository contains notes, examples, and small labs to help you understand how to design, implement, and evaluate agentic systems using the OpenAI SDK.

## Who this is for
- Developers new to agentic AI who know basic JavaScript/TypeScript or Python.
- Engineers who want hands-on experiments with SDK-based agents, tool-use, and safety patterns.

## Learning goals
1. Understand what "agentic AI" means and typical agent architectures.
2. Learn to use the OpenAI SDK to build simple agents and tool integrations.
3. Practice chaining prompts, managing context, and handling uncertainty.
4. Explore evaluation and safety best practices for agents.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16 (for JavaScript/TypeScript labs) or Python 3.8+ (for Python notes).
- An OpenAI API key and familiarity with environment variables.
- Basic knowledge of async programming and REST concepts.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Create issues for topics you'd like to see or open PRs with example improvements, clearer guides, or additional labs.


## Note for developers

This repository uses TypeScript / JavaScript examples by default. The agent patterns, designs, and exercises are language‑agnostic — if you prefer Python, the concepts remain the same; you only need to adapt syntax and libraries to Python.

Quick tips for Python developers:
- Translate JS/TS examples to Python idioms (async/await, context handling, package imports).
- Replace client libraries with their Python equivalents (e.g., OpenAI Python SDK).
- Tests and examples can be rewritten using pytest or unittest.
- Contributions translating examples or adding Python labs are welcome — please open a PR.
