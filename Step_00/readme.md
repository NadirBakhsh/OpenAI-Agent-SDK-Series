## Step_00: Introduction to Agentic AI

Welcome to Step 00 of the OpenAI Agent SDK Series! In this introductory step, we will explore the fundamental concepts of agentic AI, its significance, and how it differs from traditional AI systems. This step sets the foundation for building more complex agents in subsequent steps.

### What are Agents?
Agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional AI models that respond to direct inputs, agents can operate independently, adapt to changing conditions, and utilize various tools and resources to accomplish tasks.

### Key Concepts

1. **LLM** - Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 serve as the "brain" of many agents, providing natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

2. **Tool Use** - Agents can leverage external tools (e.g., APIs, databases) to enhance their capabilities and perform complex tasks beyond text generation.

3. **Tool for Agents** - These agents can decide when and how to use tools based on the context of the task at hand.

4. **Guardrails** - Safety mechanisms to ensure agents operate within defined ethical and operational boundaries.

5. **Tracing** - Monitoring and logging agent actions for transparency and debugging.

6. **Multiple Agents** - Complex systems may involve multiple agents collaborating or competing to achieve goals.

7. **Streaming** - Real-time interaction and response generation by agents.

8. **MCP** - Multi-Channel Processing, allowing agents to handle inputs and outputs across various modalities (text, images, etc.).
